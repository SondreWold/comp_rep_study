Studies that dissect the hidden representations of deep neural networks are commonplace in machine learning research. A long-standing problem within the field has been to determine to what extent these representations are modular and specialized. For example, if a model is trained on an arithmetic dataset, is there a part of the model that computes addition, and is this part  distinguishable from the part that computes subtraction? Recently, the field of mechanistic interpretability has become a popular approach for answering such questions. This is typically done by identifying so-called circuits, which are subnetworks that correspond to the individual operations involved in solving a task.

In this work, we study the compositional nature of circuits in transformer models. We aim to identify the subnetworks that correspond to the individual operations involved in solving a task. We investigate the extent to which these subnetworks are modular and specialized, and how they interact with each other.
