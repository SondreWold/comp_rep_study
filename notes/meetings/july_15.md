Note from our meeting on 15th of July 2024.

## Immediate Next Steps
The following steps should be done next:

- Rerun sweeps with:
  - 100 epochs
  - val log every 20 epochs
  - create tokenizer path
  - Log cross entropy + L1 loss (without lambda) and optimize on it for sweeps
- Retrain model masks with best config and evaluate on all subtasks
- Implement method for operating on subnetworks
  - Comparing them (IoU)
  - Unary, intersection, inverse
- Literature Review on SAE
